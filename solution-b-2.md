## Branching strategies 

1. Feature Branch Workflow:
Main Branch: Usually main or master.
Feature Branches: New features are developed in dedicated branches and merged back into the main branch upon completion. In this assignment, test branch has been used as the feature branch

2. Gitflow Workflow:
Main Branch: main or master.
Develop Branch: Intermediate branch for ongoing development.
Feature Branches: For new features.
Release Branches: Preparing releases.
Hotfix Branches: Emergency fixes for production.

3. GitHub Flow:
Main Branch: main or master.
Feature Branches: Similar to the Feature Branch Workflow, but with direct deployment from feature branches to production after code review.

4. Trunk-Based Development:
Main Branch: main or master.
Feature Flags: Features are hidden behind feature flags until they are ready for release.

5. Release Branch Workflow:
Main Branch: main or master.
Release Branches: For preparing releases.

6. GitOps Workflow:
Main Branch: main or master.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Focuses on declarative configuration and automated deployment of infrastructure. Terraform and ArgoCD can be used for this.


## Best Practices for Writing Efficient CI/CD Pipelines:

**Parallelism**:

Leverage parallel jobs or stages to speed up the pipeline.

**Artifact Caching:**

Cache dependencies or build artifacts to avoid redundant work. Google artifact registry (GAR)/ AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) can be used for this.


**Incremental Builds:**

Only rebuild what is necessary. Use tools like make or dependency analysis.

**Notifications:**

Notify relevant teams or individuals about pipeline status (success or failure).


**Environment Isolation:**

Ensure that each environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod) is isolated and reflects the intended state.


**Security Scans:**

Include security scans in the pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early. SUch as hadolint and trivy


**Automated Testing:**

Include comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.


**Deployment Automation:**

Automate deployment steps to reduce the chance of human error.


**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

Use IaC principles to manage infrastructure changes alongside code changes.


**Environment Promotion:**

Promote the same artifact through different environments to ensure consistency - based on requirements.


**Rollbacks:**

Implement automated rollback procedures in case of deployment failures.

**Documentation:**

Document the pipeline steps and configuration for ease of maintenance.

**Versioning:**

versioning CI/CD pipeline configuration for traceability.

**Logs and Artifacts Storage:**

Store logs and build artifacts for future reference and debugging.

**Continuous Improvement:**

Regularly review and optimize the CI/CD pipeline for performance and efficiency.
